# Explore Rhode Island

Explore cool, quirky places in [Rhode Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island).

This is the capstone project for [The Vanilla JS Academy](https://vanillajsacademy.com/). It fetches data from an API and renders it using [Reef](https://reefjs.com/): a micro-library for creating reactive, state-based components.

Users can mark items as favourites or already visited. This data will persist across page loads. They can also filter the current view between:

* All Places
* Favourites
* Visited
* Not Visited
